I have a strong background in Tableau and Python-based Machine Learning solutions. I am also comfortable in R programming based implementations for statistical and machine learning use cases as well. I can operate efficiently in an agile start-up scenario and a process-driven enterprise environment. I am a passionate self-learner who leverages emerging technologies. I am also capable of strategically incorporating team member feedback for producing the highest quality data products. My expertise in the data domain are building financial analytics, spatial analytics and people analytics solutions.

In my spare time I am a CELTA qualified English teacher who is passionate about teaching English to non-native speakers and thus far have coached many students to become successful in their chosen English language exams like IELTS, PTE, Cambridge C1 and Cambridge C2 to name a few. 

As hobbies I read Science fiction and psychology books. I also enjoy reading the latest behavioural economics publications as well.
